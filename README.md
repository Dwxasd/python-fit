python-fit
======

A module for python using numpy that makes fitting data to predefined and user-defined functions a breeze. Designed to be as easy to use as the fitting methods in ROOT.

"The best camera you own is the one you have on you when a picture falls in your lap". Building on that mentality, this software is not designed for huge amounts of control over the minimization process but rather tries to make fitting data simple and painless. Thus, if you want to fit data several times a day, every day, maybe check out this software. If you want one very statistically aware, well understood, neurotically precise fit, maybe you should look elsewhere.
